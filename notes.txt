To test dreamtools/synapseclient on travis, we must provide a login/password.

Of course, it cannot be added in the repository. Instead, we will provide an
encoded version (test.synapseConfig.enc). On travis side, a hidden environment
variable will contain the key to decode that file. 

We need to create the file test.synapseConfig.enc ; Starting from the input file
that looks like::


    [authentication]
    username: email@somewhere
    password: xxxx

Let assume the input file is called test.synapseConfig, then just type::

    openssl aes-256-cbc -in test.synapseConfig -out test.synapseConfig.enc

You will need to enter a password, which is the encrypted file.
