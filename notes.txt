To test dreamtools/synapseclient on travis, we must provide a login/password.

Of course, it cannot be added in the repository. Instead, we will provide an
encoded version (test.synapseConfig.enc). On travis side, a hidden environment
variable will contain the key to decode that file. 

We need to create the file test.synapseConfig.enc ; Starting from the input file
that looks like::


    [authentication]
    username: email@somewhere
    password: xxxx

Let assume the input file is called test.synapseConfig, then type::

    openssl aes-256-cbc -in test.synapseConfig -out test.synapseConfig.enc -p -nosalt

You will need to enter a password, which is the encrypted file. Keep the
password  !

The -nosalt option seems recommended.  http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/29106/openssl-recover-key-and-iv-by-passphrase

The -p option will print information (key + iv) These should be keep for
decryption !


To decrypt::

openssl aes-256-cbc -K
C152765FB55FC312775CA146EE24A0EC04C3CD745747A412916848F7780C851C -iv
82E85ADBAA6C87CF8058C7A7B31C99FD -in test.synapseConfig.enc -d -out test.dec
